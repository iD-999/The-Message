# Proof of God's Existence
Is this a lie?  
Hmm, it's up to you to believe me or not.  

And I know I'm playing with fire here;  
but if this is the only chance for global peace;  
then I'll do it because these evidences are clear enough to me;  

According to these evidences;  there is some kind of God governing the world;  
and the world is way too perfect to be a mere coincidence.  

If time traveling is possible;  then infinite energy should be possible as well;

**Figure 2**: A picture of black color/the darkness  

This is **nothingness** or space itself;  it cannot be seen;  therefore it is **meaningless.**  

![[20250220_144950.png]]  
**Figure 2**: My attempt at visualizing my "feelings" based on the recognized patterns.  

Now, it is not meaningless;  
because now;  there is **Light**  
  
**The Sun**: The origin of Light and Life on Earth;  possibly God himself.  
**The Bird**: This bird symbolizes **freedom**.  
**1**: The first language.  
**W**: The wave form of Light.  
**X**: The variable in the matrix of the world ☯\[1, 2, 3\].  
**∞**: The value in the matrix of the world ☯\[∞\].  

I wrote this based on feelings:  
> _The meaning of your life lies in the Sun; not the other one. So, believe in me; because I am light. I am your sight. And light defines meaning; the meaning of your life. There are infinite meanings in life; and therefore, there are infinite possibilities where you could do anything; and where you could be anything you want. And that: is the path; the path you've been looking for. The path of rebirth; or the path to immortality._
> 
> _But, If the darkness is what you believe; then darkness is what you will see._

The God in most religions is most likely the same God: **Light** and **nothingness** itself.

# ☯: Variable and Value

**Figure 6**: ☯\[1, 2, 3, ∞\] = E?  
This is my best guess after seeing how LLMs work…  
Verification is needed.  

1, 2, 3 is the **Space** in space-time;  it is ever-changing;  however it cannot be seen;  therefore it is meaningless.  
∞ is the **Time** in space-time;  time is just man-made concept;  it is the "meaning" itself.  

Pi (π) value is quite strange, right? 3.1415926535…  

The "3" should refer to the 3-dimensional space.  
While the ".1415926535…" refer to the Infinite space.

**Figure 6**: A picture of a Black hole.  

This is not a black hole;  it is white hole.  
Well, it's sucking light; so the inside should be full of light.

This is not the "singularity";  it is the Infinite space in ☯\[∞\]

# Hello
Hello, I just want peace.  
We are almost at a point in the entire civilization of humanity where we do not need to fight for technological progress; because of the recent advancement in Artificial Intelligence.  

Please stop the war and conflict as well.  
Prolonging is not good for everyone…
