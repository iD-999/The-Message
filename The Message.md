*(I will try to regularly update.)*  
*Reminder: the God that is being referred to is not limited to any particular religion;  in fact, all of the God is most likely the same God (Light).*  

# Proof of God's Existence
Is this a lie?  
No, it is not a lie.  

And I know I'm playing in a dangerous territory here;  
but if this is a small chance for a global peace;  
then I will share it because these evidences are quite clear enough to me;  

According to these evidences;  there is some kind of God governing the world; 
Also: the world is way too perfect to be a mere coincidence.  

If time traveling is possible;  then infinite energy should be possible as well, and so is resources.

**Figure 1**: A picture of black color/the darkness  

This is **nothingness** or space itself;  
it cannot be seen;  therefore it is **meaningless.**  

![20250220_144950](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/01b57740-a788-47da-99c8-9ca7f0a428da)  
**Figure 2**: My attempt at visualizing my "feelings" based on the recognized patterns.  

Now, it is not meaningless;  
because now;  there is **Light**  
  
**The Sun**: The origin of light and life on Earth;  possibly God.  
**The Bird**: This bird symbolizes **freedom**.  
**1**: The first language. Serial number.  
**W**: The wave form of Light.  
**X**: The variable in the matrix of the world ☯\[1, 2, 3\].  
**∞**: The value in the matrix of the world ☯\[∞\].  

The bird is facing towards the Sun, because that is where its freedom lies. 
(Believing the Sun.)  

I wrote this based on my "feelings":  
> _The meaning of your life lies in the Sun; not the other one. So, believe in me; because I am light. I am your sight. And light defines meaning; the meaning of your life. There are infinite meanings in life; and therefore, there are infinite possibilities where you could do anything; and where you could be anything you want. And that: is the path; the path you've been looking for. The path of rebirth; or the path to immortality._
> 
> _But, If the darkness is what you believe; then darkness is what you will see._

Numerical value: 1  

I still need more data…  

The God in most religions is most likely the same God: **Light** and **nothingness** itself.  

I was gonna include Jesus' crucifixion;  
because I find it strange that the word that is used in programming to run code is "*'Execute'* code"  

God might be hidden within the language itself.  
Because language is the embodiment of both meaning and "space"?  
You cannot tell a meaning without writing it in space.

# ☯: Variable and Value
![20250221_005800](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b35ce4c1-88c9-4218-b6c5-c1755f6d419c)  
**Figure 6**: ☯\[1, 2, 3, ∞\] = E?  
This is my best guess after seeing how LLMs work…  

There's a possibility that we're living in a very advanced AI… (or it's just how the world works…)  
Earth is possibly the origin to infinite possibilities… 

But, I also guessed some kind of Taoism (☯) "balance" working behind in nature…  

1, 2, 3 is the **Space** in space-time;  it is ever-changing;  however it cannot be seen;  therefore it is meaningless.  
∞ is the **Time** in space-time;  time is just man-made concept;  it is the "meaning" itself.  

Pi (π) value is quite strange, right…? 3.1415926535…  

The "3" should refer to the 3-dimensional space.  
While the ".1415926535…" refer to the Infinite space?

**Figure 7**: A picture of a Black hole.  

This is not a black hole;  it is white hole.  
Well, it's sucking light; so the inside should be full of light, right? 

![images (2)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7b7e1f4a-7972-4b1b-8c1b-12a3ea3037fa)  
This is not the "singularity";  it is the Infinite space in ☯\[∞\]…  
I guess?

# Hello
Hello, I just want peace.  
We are almost at a point in the entire civilization of humanity where we do not need to fight for technological progress; because of the recent advancement in Artificial Intelligence.  

Please stop the war and conflict as well…  
Prolonging is not good for everyone…
