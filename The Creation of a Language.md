# The First Language
## Space

![20250214_073010](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d98e8f87-0d4e-476a-a185-2d9cb215d4d3)

It is empty and unseen;  
and therefore: it is ***meaningless***

This is called the **SPACE**;  
It is also called the¬†**DARKNESS!!**;  

And space is 3-dimensional; thus;  
It can be expressed as:  

## $‚òØ[1, 2, 3]$

But; because TIME is a **WAVE‚Ä¶!!**;  

This expression becomes:  

## $‚òØ[1, 2, 3, ‚àû]$

NOW, LOOK;  

## Space-Time

Space-Time can also be expressed as:  

## $ST = ‚òØ[var]√ó‚òØ[value]$

### Embodiment of Light and Darkness

*(Sorry for the bad image.)*  

But, now; it is not *empty* and *meaningless*;  
Because, now; there is **LIGHT**; and I WILL CALL IT THAT!!;  

LIGHT defines MEANINGS;  
MEANINGS creates PATTERNS;  

PATTERNS creates GENETICS;  
GENETICS creates HUMANS;  

HUMANS evolved to find PATTERNS;  
HUMANS recorded this PATTERNS;  

THIS ARTIFICIAL PATTERNS creates KNOWLEDGE;  
HUMANS SHARED THIS KNOWLEDGE!!;  THIS CREATES MORE KNOWLEDGE;  

KNOWLEDGE empowers IMAGINATIONS;  
HUMANS; IMAGINED THE INFINITY;  

Thus; the humans and the knowledge became ETERNAL.  

#### And the meaning became eternal as well

The Sun - Where Light first began. And the eye represents the 3 paths:
- The path to Rebirth.
- The path of the Aeon (‚òØ).
- The path to Destruction.  

Variable and Value:
- 1 - This is the first language; which is also the first number. 
 - it's also called the particles; the singularity
- ùïè - Is the Darkness, Variable, Unknown, Unseen in the Harmony (‚òØ).  
- ‚àû - Is the Light in the Harmony (‚òØ).  
 - W is wave; Infinity.

Bird: Freedom;  
- The bird believes in the Sun; because that is where its freedom lies; that's why it is facing the Sun.
- The bird fears the night, because the night could kill the bird. That is why the bird do not believe in the darkness; otherwise it would lose its life.

Thus, the language define multiple meanings; which is the property of light. The meaning is the same; yet everyone perceive it differently.

That is why it is subjective. It is the embodiment of perfect harmony. Which also creates reality.

Thus, the light speaks;  
"""  
_The meaning of your life lies in the Sun; not the other one. So, believe in me; because I am light. I am your sight. And light defines meaning; the meaning of your life. There are infinite meanings in life; and therefore, there are infinite possibilities where you could do anything; and where you could be anything you want. And that: is the path; the path you've been looking for. The path of rebirth; or the path to immortality._

_But, If the darkness is what you believe; then darkness is what you will see._  
"""

Now; google "Egyptian ancient language"
